This is where I will upload my final paper

[blah blah blah intro] I decided there would be five variables in my definition, as this seemed like a versatile but not overwhelming number. The user will be prompted to input their own option for each of the five variables, so I didn’t want there to be so many that it became boring. The five variables would be phrased in the form of questions:
What is a book? 
Who makes it?
Where is it made?
What tools are used? 
What is its purpose? 
I began this project by analyzing the definitions of a book which my peers and I generated in the second week of the semester. Of the five categories, only 1, 5, and a bit of 2 were addressed.[^1] One can extrapolate from this that at the beginning of the course, we weren’t thinking a lot about how books are actually manufactured. Or at least, we didn’t think of the manufacturing process as inherent to the definition of a book. 
By contrast, however, many did think of certain physical characteristics as inherent to the book. [This](link) word cloud which I created using [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=48b402d2486d6d4613d3b443ca329a62) highlights well what we were thinking about at the beginning of the course. The most recurring element, which was mentioned 18 times, was the presence of “pages.” In addition, descriptions of those pages as being “bound” and having a “cover” were also common. Many people felt the need to include these material characteristics in their definition, but often with the caveat that the pages may or may not be “physical,” i.e. that they may be paper or displayed on some type of digital screen.
