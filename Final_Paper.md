# Defining the Book in the Digital Age

Defining the book in the digital age, or in any age, is a challenging endeavour.  “The book” has meant many things to many people throughout history. This project, which derives often contradictory definitions by randomly combining a finite set of variables, is meant to reflect those different meanings, and place them on the level playing field of digital randomization. This will hopefully encourage the viewer to examine their assumptions in their historical context, and additionally, incite the viewer to engage in and explore the challenges which arise. 

To make my program, I chose to create five variables, answering five key questions, which would form my rudimentary definition. Each variable contains a list of words or phrases, one of which the program will randomly pull every time it runs. To fill my lists ([visible here](https://github.com/zoe-f-cyborg/definition_of_a_book_project/blob/main/list.md)), I chose to examine the forum posts defining the book which my peers and I posted in week 2 of this course, (White) and expanded on them where appropriate. 

## Question 1: What is a book? 

This question is the broadest and most basic one we will deal with, thus the most challenging to turn into a succinct list. Excluding elements which will be addressed later, such as purpose and maker, the forum posts for this question mainly discussed physical characteristics, content, and access. Below is a word cloud [generated in Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=48b402d2486d6d4613d3b443ca329a62) showing the words which were most frequently used in our definitions.

The most frequent word, with 18 mentions, was “pages.” In addition, descriptions of those pages as being “bound” and having a “cover” were also common. Many people felt the need to include these material characteristics in their definition, but often with the caveat that these characteristics may or may not be “physical,” i.e. that they may be paper or displayed on some type of digital screen. This accounts for many of the instances when the word “physical” was used. To acknowledge this definition, I included "a physical object," as well as a few non-physical definitions, in my list for question 1.

Students were keenly aware of the challenges of defining the book this way. “I've been struggling with this!” one student said. “Are we defining physical characteristics of a book, or what content makes a book?” Indeed, many students did discuss content in their definitions. Words like “information,” “collection,” “words,” “fiction,” and “story” show the range of content that we imagined books to have. Some of us were clearly thinking mostly about the novel; for example, the student who defined a book as “more than 80 pages (less than that is a novella)” and stated that “it should include a beginning, middle and end.” Some were thinking much more broadly, however. Many discussed “information” instead of story, highlighting how books have been not just a means of sharing fiction but of conveying and preserving matters of fact. One commenter said that books and novels differ  “because novels are plot driven, but books don't have to be.” Another even said that a book “doesn't necessarily have to have words within it,” that is, that a book of pictures is still a book.

Although many of these definitions were complex and thoughtful, they often lacked historical insight. Students thought deeply about the tension between the codex and the e-book, but they were not thinking about the medieval manuscript. For example, one student included portability as a characteristic of the book. This is a characteristic that most modern paperbacks and ebooks share, however, it is not shared with the heavy, unwieldy, and expensive volumes of medieval [chained libraries](https://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/the-last-of-the-great-chained-libraries/). In addition, a few of us thought about accessibility, but few with a historical insight into how access to books and book making materials has always been limited. In a world of libraries, sites like [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/inlibrary), and a culture which generally encourages reading, we may think of access to books as ubiquitous; however, this notion is actually quite recent. Before the rise of the mass market paperback at the end of the 19th century (Striphas 32), and certainly before the invention of the printing press, books were an expensive luxury. In the middle ages, they were not vectors for mass entertainment but almost exclusively used for scripture (Encyclopedia Britannica, “The revival of the secular book trade”). The idea of the book in history differs greatly from the idea we have now.

## Question 2: Who makes it? 
This question was meant to allow us to examine the notion of authorship, and who exactly can be credited with “making” a book. Beginning arguably in the 14th century with Vasari’s [*Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects*](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Giorgio-Vasari#ref37617) (Encyclopaedia Britannica) and continuing through to the present day, we have an idea of “the artist” as an isolated individual. This idea is reflected in the student mentions of authorship. Of the four mentions of “author,” only one included and “(s)” to indicate the potential for multiple authors. Books, in this view, represent the “cohesive” or “comprehensive” (other words which popped up in the word cloud) vision of an author, usually a singular author. This explains the claim which one student made that “a book is someone's world... it transports one into the mind or experiences of another.” 

Of course, this idea of the artist overlooks all of the other people involved in book production. In the modern publishing industry, there are not only authors but editors, designers, publicists, and legal consultation. There are also people who design and operate the printing equipment. In early book publishing, although the operation was often smaller, there would have been “bulls” pulling the presses in printing houses, as well as papermakers and bookbinders (EB, “The age of early printing”). For this list, I included some of the individuals who might claim to have made the book, such as “publicist” and “printer” and “editor,” and also “a team of collaborators.” Although this last answer may seem most “correct,” none of the others are actually wrong, but merely highlight different aspects of book production. It is my hope that by bringing each of these individual elements to the viewer’s attention, it will incite them to think more about how that specific role plays into the overall idea of “a book.” 

## Question 3: How is it made? I.e., what tools are used and where? 

This question is not well reflected in the forum posts. One student did comment that a book “is printed on paper rather than something like papyrus,” but other than that, minimal reference was made to the manufacturing of books. I still wanted to include this variable in the project because there have been so many different eras book production has gone through, and so many different approaches to their physical construction. There have been monks in scriptoriums copying texts and designs onto vellum, there have been printing presses and font faces, there have been laser printers and word processors. I felt the need to include one variable which could briefly represent a few of those different material production methods. This variable will also provide for more thought-provoking and humorous juxtapositions, such as "a monk sending an email," or "a publicist pulling a printing press."  

## Question 4: How is it read?

This is a very interesting question which a few of the students at the beginning of the course engaged in, explicitly or implicitly. Specifically, we explored whether the reading of a book is linear or non-linear, silent or aloud, public or private, and close or distant. One student defined the book as a “document that can be read in both a linear (from front to back) and / or non-linear (starting to read at any point within the document) fashion.” This is an idea which Stallybrass builds on when he argues that the indexical, almost hypertextual nature of the codex contributed to the development of Christianity (42-74). Modern readers may have a tendency to think that the only proper way to read a book is linear, front to back, but these accounts suggest that the exact opposite is true. Books, the fact that they have pages which can be indexed and marked and rapidly flipped between, are uniquely positioned to be read in a non-linear fashion. 

One student also mentioned the potential for auditory reading, saying that books can be in “audio form.” There is more historical precedent for this than the student likely realized. It was only “in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries” that silent reading truly began to emerge in England (Jajdelska 4). Before this, reading aloud was the norm, and those who read silently were considered rather odd, for example, in [Augustine’s account of observing Ambrose read without moving his lips](https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Manguel/Silent_Readers.html). This method of reading presents a challenge to non-linear reading since it is much harder to index, bookmark, and skim an audiobook. 

This transition from reading aloud to reading silently brought with it the distinction between reading publicly and reading privately. Although reading aloud was not necessarily public— often people read aloud to themselves, or only to intimate companions (Jajdelska  37)— this new widespread silent reading practice did bring with it changes in the style of some books. Published diaries, for example, became less public informational documents, and instead “created a relationship with an implied reader in an intimate and confidential setting” (165). This supports the notion that we discussed in Question 2 of the book as something which “transports one into the mind or experiences of another.” The book in this view is a private, intitmate transmission from author to reader.

This is not to say that reading nowadays is always private, silent, or non-linear. The existence of book clubs, bookshelves where people display their books, and websites like Goodreads testify that there is still a large public component to book reading. Reading is “promiscuous, networked, and above all social” (Nakamura 242). The increasing popularity of audiobooks indicates that the book as an auditory form may also be making a comeback. The practice of reading aloud may challenge the notion of the book as non-linear and hypertextual, since an audiobook is more like a scroll in that it is difficult to flip through. These historically rooted reading conventions are all, therefore, under scrutiny in the digital age. 

Another historical reading convention which the digital age challenges is that of close reading. Close reading, the process of sitting down with a small corpus and picking it apart, is the only form of reading widely accepted in academic circles as intellectually legitimate (Hayles 63-64); however, it is by its nature exclusive, requiring a small canon of texts, and therefore has the potential to overlook major sources of knowledge (Moretti “Distant Reading”). 20 years ago, the idea of “distant reading” was introduced by Franco Moretti as a potential solution to this problem. He suggested that we ought to pursue methods of reading which bring us more general knowledge about a much larger corpus, rather than a lot of knowledge about a small one. Tools like [Voyant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyant_Tools) and [AntConc](http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/AntConc) can provide valuable assistance with this task, giving us a sort of digital summary of texts we would never have the time to read closely first-hand. In addition to distant reading, computers also assist us in hyperreading, a method of reading which most people who spend any time online will be familiar with. This is the sometimes distracted, fragmentary, and fast-paced type of reading that the internet is built for, including things like skimming, scanning, and keyword searches (Hayles 66-67). Ebooks allow us to apply this style of reading to the book. If you’ve ever used control+F to find a quote you like in an ebook, you have engaged in hyperreading.

## Question 5: What is its purpose? 

Here there were a variety of perspectives. As already discussed, many identified the purpose of a book as telling a story, exploring another person’s mind, or transmitting information. Another purpose which was hinted at was the idea that the purpose of a book is to make money. One student defined the book as having “an eye-catching cover." Giving your books an "eye-catching cover" is a marketing tactic used to get potential buyers to notice a book and hopefully buy it. Medieval and early modern codices often didn’t have identifying or attention-grabbing covers because in the early ages of printing and manuscript making books were usually commissioned rather than sold in a store. This shows that the physical characteristics of a book, which are part of its definition, are clearly affected by market demands. Books are designed, at least in part, to make people money.

Books can also be a means of education and a demonstration of wealth. One student describes the purpose of the book optimistically as designed to “educate, provoke deeper thought and provide new understanding.” But what exactly are people being educated in when they read? Striphas suggests that one historical purpose of the book is to “to rehearse and refine” (31) the skills of middle class life. In this way, it may be said that books are a means of control. They have the potential to dictate how we ought to behave. In addition, Striphas touches on the public and performative aspect of book-buying when he describes the history of bookbacks, fake books which people bought to fill their book shelves (28). Books in this view are “meant to be accumulated and displayed,” (31) they exist to signal one’s wealth and education. These less pleasant and idealistic ideas of a book’s purpose were largely absent from the forum posts.

## Conclusion
At the beginning of this course, our definitions of the book were idealistic and centred around present-day experience. Our definitions considered material characteristics but not material production. We often imagined the modern paperback as the book qua book, overlooking historical eras in which the novel was quite different in terms of both material, production, content, and access. The range of definitions which my program offers demonstrates a greater awareness of the history of the book and its role in the market, however, it still suffers from all the limitations of circumstance. It doesn’t explore further back in time than the medieval era, and it has an intensely english perspective. It might also broaden the definition too much. For example, I don’t consider for a moment that audio books or ebooks might *not* actually be books. Above all, this is a program curated by me, thus overrepresents my own perspective and interests. A potential next phase for this project could be adding a mechanism which records and saves user inputs and adds them to the list. This could create a much larger amalgamated definition of the book, one which allows users to build the definition together.
