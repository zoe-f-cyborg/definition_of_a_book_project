# Defining the Book in the Digital Age
This is my final project for DIGH3001A:ENGL3401A, "The Book in the Digital Age." 

This project was inspired by [Pedro Barbarossa's Cyberliterature project](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/works/cyberliterature/PB_ELC3.html#annotations:eczrKBJ5Eeul8YvJvHSACA), which randomly generates poems based on a program he designed. I took the structure of that project and applied to a different format: A definition instead of a poem. The following project creates a randomly generated definition of a book, based ona combination of pre-set variables and user inputs. 

Using it is very simple: open [online-python.com](https://www.online-python.com/). Copy the code from the ["Code"](https://github.com/zoe-f-cyborg/definition_of_a_book_project/blob/main/Code) page in this github repsitory, and paste it into that program. Then hit "run" and enjoy!
P.S. you can adjust the lower window on online python website to make it more user friendly.
